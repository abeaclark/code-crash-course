# Code Crash Course

## Course Description:

The goal of this course is to lay a foundation for someone who has little to no experience writing code to become a full-stack software developer. Upon completion, you will feel confident enough to create a functioning CRUD API in python, a stand-alone frontend in Javascript, and integrate with helpful 3rd-party APIs.

The concepts covered will give you a strong foundation so that you can go on to learn other programming languages with confidence.

## Approach:
This is a self-led course. The goal of the course material is to give you **brief** introductions to important concepts, organized in a logical manner. It also provides helpful resources to learn & practice these concepts in greater depth.

If at any point you think that an activity, link, reading, etc. is not helping you learn, then skip it an go on.

## Languages we'll cover:
* html
* css
* javascript (vanilla, jquery, React)
* python
* sql (basics)
