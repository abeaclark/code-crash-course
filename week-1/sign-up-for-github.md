## Sign up for Github

[Github](https://github.com/) -- Github is a cloud-based, free (for public repositories) place for you to store your code. You can collaborate with other developers on projects. You can also find LOTS of very helpful "Packages" that other developers have built that help you accomplish specific tasks in the language of your choice.

Work through these tasks:
* :white_check_mark: [What is Github?](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* :white_check_mark: [Introduction to git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
