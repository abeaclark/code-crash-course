## SQL
SQL is the language used to interact with Relational Databases. It has lots of functions but a few of the most common are:
* Create a table
* Update a table
* Find a row by ID
* Find rows by attributes
* Update a row
* Delete a row

Honestly, I'm not very good with SQL. In web development, you typically will access the database through an ORM (see next section). However, it is good to have a base knowledge of the language because it helps you think about what is going on under the hood, and you may need to create / edit sql occasionally.
