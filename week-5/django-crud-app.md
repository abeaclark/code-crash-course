## Django CRUD app
Now that you understand how to use models, migrations, and views, you are prepared to create fully functioning web apps. You also have enough knowledge to start following other online Django tutorials successfully. Since you know how different pieces work, you'll be able to better follow what the tutorials are doing.

I would suggest running through several of these tutorials to create basic CRUD apps in Django. When it comes to setting up the environment / code structure, don't be afraid to use the things we have practiced.

#### Practice tutorials:
* [Create a Polls App](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Django Girls Blog](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/)
* [Mozilla Local Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website)
